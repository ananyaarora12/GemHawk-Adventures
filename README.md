# Game-Development

Gemhawks is a 2D platformer game created using Unity. This was made as part of our 3rd semester project. The game invites players into a world filled with adventure and discovery. Set across two meticulously crafted levels, each with its own theme and increasing difficulty, the game challenges players to navigate through a series of obstacles and enemies all while collecting gems to reach the end flag.

## Storyline
Long ago, there was a sunny land where every creature lived in harmony and happiness. The days were filled with warmth, and the air resonated with laughter. However, one sudden day, thunderclouds appeared and the trees began to wither.

"What's happening?" cried the fox, alarmed by the sudden change. It turned out that an evil eagle, hungry for power, had cursed the sunny land. Frantic, the creatures sought counsel from the wise old owl, known for her ancient wisdom.

"Only the mystical Purple Sapphires of Sunny Land can save this place now," declared the owl solemnly. The fox, though scared, bravely stood up to lead the quest to save his homeland from the curse. Will you help the fox collect the magical sapphires and restore harmony to Sunny Land?
